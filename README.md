## üîç Detailed Analysis

### Strategic Decision-Making Framework

#### 1. Prioritization Matrix
```python
# Complaint Prioritization Logic
def prioritize_actions(complaint_data):
    high_volume = complaint_data[complaint_data['count'] > threshold]
    high_growth = complaint_data[complaint_data['growth_rate'] > 0.2]
    critical_measures = ['Safety', 'Legal', 'Quality']
    
    return {
        'immediate_action': high_volume & critical_measures,
        'strategic_focus': high_growth & high_volume,
        'monitor': low_volume & low_growth
    }
```

#### 2. Risk Assessment Model
- **High Risk**: Products with increasing complaint trends and high volumes
- **Medium Risk**: Stable high volumes or rapidly growing low volumes
- **Low Risk**: Low volumes with decreasing trends

### Business Impact Analysis

#### Operational Efficiency
- **Resource Allocation**: Direct support teams to high-complaint areas
- **Process Optimization**: Identify bottleneck processes causing repeated issues
- **Quality Control**: Enhance inspection and testing for problematic products

#### Customer Experience
- **Satisfaction Improvement**: Address root causes of frequent complaints
- **Retention Strategies**: Proactive outreach for affected customer segments
- **Service Training**: Target training based on specific complaint measures

    'product_subcategory', 
    'complaint_measure',
    'complaint_date',
    'resolution_status',
    'customer_segment',
    'geographic_region'
]
```

#### 2. Data Cleaning
